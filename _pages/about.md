I am Isaac Pincus, a scientist and engineer by training, with expertise in rheology, soft matter, and computational physics. Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm broadly interested in applying computational and theoretical modelling to better understand and model physical processes in micro- and meso-scale systems. I did my PhD at Monash University, Australia, supervised by [Ravi Jagadeshan](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/ravi-jagadeeshan) and [Alison Rodger](https://chemistry.anu.edu.au/people/prof-alison-rodger), followed by postdocs at MIT working with [Gareth McKinley](https://nnf.mit.edu/people/alumni) and [Maggie Qi](https://qigroup.mit.edu/team/), and at the University of Lausanne working with [Pietro de Anna](https://pietrodeanna.org/pda/). 

Welcome to my webpage! 



Here you will find information 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
